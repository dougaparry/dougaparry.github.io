I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Communication Science at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, with interests in Communication Science, Human-Computer Interaction, and Media Psychology. Within the Department of Communication Science, I am part of the Media Psychology Group and I research 1) the ways in which adolescents and young adults use digital media; 2) the potential effects that this behaviour can have on their cognition, mental health, and well-being; and 3) the knowledge and skills that enable them to thrive in a digital society.

I am an advocate of mixed methods and routinely combine quantitative, qualitative, and computational methods. I also have experience with systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Across these approaches, I follow [open science practices](https://academic.oup.com/joc/article/71/1/1/5803422) and, wherever possible, I aim to make my materials, data, and analyses publicly available. My research has been published in leading journals in Socio-Informatics (and related fields), such as: _Nature Human Behaviour_; _Journal of Communication_; _Technology, Mind and Behaviour_; _JAMA Pediatrics_; _Media Psychology; _Journal of Psychopathology and Clinical Science_; _Information Technology & People_; _Computers & Education_; _Behaviour Research Methods_; and _Computers in Human Behaviour_.
